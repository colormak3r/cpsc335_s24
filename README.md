## Usage:

### For Linux
Open a terminal in the same directory as r.sh and project3.cpp. Assuming g++ was installed pior on the machine, run the following command
```bash
sh r.sh
```
An alternative way is to compile project3.cpp directly using g++
```bash
g++ -o project3.out project3.cpp
```
And run the executable using
```bash
./project3.out
```
